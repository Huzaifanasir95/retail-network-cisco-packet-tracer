# 🛠️ Retail Chain Network Infrastructure

**"Efficient, Secure, and Scalable Networking for Retail Environments"**

## 📚 Overview  
This project showcases a **Retail Chain Network Design** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, simulating secure and reliable communication across multiple stores and a central headquarters. The network integrates advanced configurations, including:  
- **Routing Protocols:** RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF  
- **Dynamic IP Allocation:** DHCP services  
- **Network Security:** Firewalls and Access Control  
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** To secure internal IP addresses

## 🚀 Key Features  

### ✅ **Network Design:**  
- Four retail stores connected to a central headquarters (HQ)  
- Fault-tolerant and redundant network architecture  

### ✅ **Routing Protocols:**  
- **RIP:** Store 1  
- **EIGRP:** Store 2 & Store 4  
- **OSPF:** Store 3  
- **Redistribution:** Between protocols at the HQ router  

### ✅ **IP Address Management:**  
- **DHCP:** Dynamic IP allocation for all devices  
- **NAT:** Implemented at Store 1 for secure public-private IP mapping  

### ✅ **Firewall Security:**  
- Protection for critical devices (POS terminals, CCTV cameras)  
- Prevent unauthorized external access

## 📊 **Network Topology Overview:**  
- HQ acts as the central routing hub  
- Four stores use distinct routing protocols  
- DHCP servers dynamically allocate IPs across devices  
- NAT and firewall ensure security and address translation
